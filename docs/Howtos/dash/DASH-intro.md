GPAC has extended support for MPEG-DASH and HLS content generation and playback. 

Basics concepts and terminology of MPEG-DASH are explained [here](DASH-basics) and, and the same terms are usually used in GPAC for both DASH and HLS.

For more information on content generation:

- read MP4Box [DASH options](mp4box-dash-opts)
- read the [dasher](dasher) filter help
- check the dash and HLS scripts in the GPAC [test suite](https://github.com/gpac/testsuite/tree/filters/scripts)

For more information on content playback:

- read the  [dashin](dashin) filter help, used whenever a DASH or HLS session is read.
- check the dash and HLS scripts in the GPAC [test suite](https://github.com/gpac/testsuite/tree/filters/scripts)


## Content Generation
If you generate your content with an third-party application such as ```ffmpeg```, make sure all your video qualities use closed GOP and have the same positions for their IDR frames.
When using GPAC, this is usually ensure by using the `fintra` option.

GPAC can be used to generate both static and live DASH/HLS content. For live cases, GPAC can expose the created files:

- directly through disk
- through its own HTTP server
- by pushing them to a remote HTTP server

We recommend reading the [HTTP server](httpout) filter help, and looking at the [DASH](LL-DASH) and [HLS](LL-HLS) low latency HowTos.


## Content Playback
GPAC comes with a various set of adaptation algorithms:

- BBA0, BOLA, basic throughput (called `conventional` in the literature)
- Custom throughput-based (`gbuf`) and buffer-based (`grate`) algorithms

The algorithm can be replaced by your own algo in [JS](jsf/jsdash) or [Python](python#custom-gpac-callbacks).
 
[Low-Latency DASH](LL-DASH) streaming is supported, and [HLS](LL-HLS) is supported starting from GPAC 2.0. 

As usual in GPAC, accessing a DASH/HLS session is not reserved for playback, it can be used to feed a media pipeline for other tasks such as transcoding, encryption, recording, etc... See [this howto](HAS-advanced) for more information.
