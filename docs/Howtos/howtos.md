This part of the wiki describes HOWTOs illustrating the various possibilities of GPAC.

Feel free to contribute your own cookbooks for media processing with GPAC !

As a starter you can check the [one-liners examples page](filters-oneliners). And as a complement you can check the [test suite scripts](https://github.com/gpac/testsuite/tree/filters/scripts): the test suite mostly consists in functional and integration tests which provide good examples of GPAC features.

_Note: most command-line examples are given with local files as input, but they can work with any URL supported by GPAC._
