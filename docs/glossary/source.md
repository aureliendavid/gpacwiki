## Troubleshooting

### No input data available
- Ensure the correct path or media source is specified and accessible.

### Invalid media format
- Verify that the source format is supported by GPAC and correctly configured.

## Example

```plaintext
gpac -i input.mp4 -o output.mp4
```

## Parameters
