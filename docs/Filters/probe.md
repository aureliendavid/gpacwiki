# Source prober  
  
Register name used to load filter: __probe__  
This filter is not checked during graph resolution and needs explicit loading.  
  
The Probe filter is used by applications (typically `MP4Box`) to query demultiplexed PIDs (audio, video, ...) available in a source chain.  
  
The filter outputs the number of input PIDs in the file specified by [log](#log).  
It is up to the app developer to query input PIDs of the prober and take appropriated decisions.
