# DASH & HLS client  
  
Register name used to load filter: __dashin__  
This filter may be automatically loaded during graph resolution.  
This filter requires the graph resolver to be activated.  
  
This filter reads MPEG-DASH, HLS and MS Smooth manifests.  
  
# Regular mode  
  
This is the default mode, in which the filter produces media PIDs and frames from sources indicated in the manifest.  
The default behavior is to perform adaptation according to [algo](#algo), but the filter can:  

- run with no adaptation, to grab maximum quality.  

Example
```
gpac -i MANIFEST_URL:algo=none:start_with=max_bw -o dest.mp4
```
  

- run with no adaptation, fetching all qualities.  

Example
```
gpac -i MANIFEST_URL:split_as -o dst=$File$.mp4
```
  
  
# File mode  
  
When [forward](#forward) is set to `file`, the client forwards media files without demultiplexing them.  
This is mostly used to expose the DASH session to a file server such as ROUTE or HTTP.  
In this mode, the manifest is forwarded as an output PID.  

__Warning: This mode cannot be set through inheritance as it changes the link capabilities of the filter. The filter MUST be explicitly declared.__  
  
To expose a live DASH session to route:  
```
gpac -i MANIFEST_URL dashin:forward=file -o route://225.0.0.1:8000/
```
  
  
If the source has dependent media streams (scalability) and all qualities and initialization segments need to be forwarded, add [split_as](#split_as).  
  
# Segment bound modes  
  
When [forward](#forward) is set to `segb` or `mani`, the client forwards media frames (after demultiplexing) together with segment and fragment boundaries of source files.  
  
This mode can be used to process media data and regenerate the same manifest/segmentation.  
  
Example
```
gpac -i MANIFEST_URL:forward=mani cecrypt:cfile=DRM.xml -o encrypted/live.mpd:pssh=mv
```
  
This will encrypt an existing DASH session, inject PSSH in manifest and segments.  
  
Example
```
gpac -i MANIFEST_URL:forward=segb cecrypt:cfile=DRM.xml -o encrypted/live.m3u8
```
  
This will encrypt an existing DASH session and republish it as HLS, using same segment names and boundaries.  
  
This mode will force [noseek](#noseek)=`true` to ensure the first segment fetched is complete, and [split_as](#split_as)=`true` to fetch all qualities.  
  
Each first packet of a segment will have the following properties attached:  

- `CueStart`: indicate this is a segment start  
- `FileNumber`: current segment number  
- `FileName`: current segment file name without manifest (MPD or master HLS) base url  
- `DFPStart`: set with value `0` if this is the first packet in the period, absent otherwise  

  
If [forward](#forward) is set to `mani`, the first packet of a segment dispatched after a manifest update will also carry the manifest payload as a property:  

- `DFManifest`: contains main manifest (MPD, M3U8 master)  
- `DFVariant`: contains list of HLS child playlists as strings for the given quality  
- `DFVariantName`: contains list of associated HLS child playlists name, in same order as manifests in `DFVariant`  

  
Each output PID will have the following properties assigned:  

- `DFMode`: set to 1 for `segb` or 2 for `mani`  
- `DCue`: set to `inband`  
- `DFPStart`: set to current period start value  
- `FileName`: set to associated init segment if any  
- `Representation`: set to the associated representation ID in the manifest  
- `DashDur`: set to the average segment duration as indicated in the manifest  
- `source_template`: set to true to indicate the source template is known  
- `stl_timescale`: timescale used by SegmentTimeline, or 0 if no SegmentTimeline  
- `init_url`: unresolved intialization URL (as it appears in the MPD or in the variant playlist)  
- `manifest_url`: manifest URL  
- `hls_variant_name`: HLS variant playlist name (as it appears in the HLS master playlist)  

  
When the [dasher](dasher) is used together with this mode, this will force all generated segments to have the same name, duration and fragmentation properties as the input ones. It is therefore not recommended for sessions stored/generated on local storage to generate the output in the same directory.
