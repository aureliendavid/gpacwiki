# HTTP input  
  
Register name used to load filter: __httpin__  
This filter may be automatically loaded during graph resolution.  
  
This filter dispatch raw blocks from a remote HTTP resource into a filter chain.  
Block size can be adjusted using [block_size](#block_size), and disk caching policies can be adjusted.  
Content format can be forced through [mime](#mime) and file extension can be changed through [ext](#ext).  
  
The filter supports both http and https schemes, and will attempt reconnecting as TLS if TCP connection fails.  
  
_Note: Unless disabled at session level (see [-no-probe](core_options/#no-probe) ), file extensions are usually ignored and format probing is done on the first data block._
